# Pizza Sales Data Analysis and Tableau Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using SQL and visualizing the results through a Tableau dashboard. The aim is to gain insights into sales patterns, customer preferences, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the pizza business.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis in SQL**:  
  The dataset was thoroughly analyzed using SQL to extract meaningful insights. Key queries were developed to identify trends in sales, popular pizza types, peak sales periods, and customer demographics.

- **Tableau Dashboard**:  
  The insights derived from the SQL analysis were then visualized using Tableau. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the sales data, allowing users to interact with various filters and visual elements to explore the data further.

## Project Components

- **Data Source**:  
  The dataset consists of detailed sales records from a pizza chain, including information on orders, pizzas and customer buying patterns.

- **SQL Analysis**:  
  Several SQL queries were crafted to analyze the dataset, focusing on:
  - Total sales and revenue
  - Most popular pizza types and toppings
  - Customer buying patterns
  - Sales distribution by time and other factors

- **Tableau Dashboard**:  
  The results of the SQL analysis were used to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau. The dashboard includes:
  - Sales trends over time
  - Top-selling pizzas and toppings
  - Sales performance by location
  - Customer segmentation

## How to Use

1. **SQL Analysis**:  
   Review the SQL queries in the `SQLQuery1.sql` file to understand how the data was analyzed.

2. **Tableau Dashboard**:  
   The Tableau workbook `Pizza_Sales_Dashboard.twb` can be opened in Tableau Desktop. Explore the interactive visualizations to gain insights from the data.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of combining SQL for data analysis with Tableau for data visualization. By analyzing the pizza sales data and visualizing it effectively, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize their operations and increase revenue.
